# BetRoyale

Bet Royale is an open source project where we build a website for betting your ROY. You can create your own bets that are about anything and set parameters for them. We are currently looking for contributors right now so if you are interested in this project, we can have a chat in the #bet-royale channel on Discord.

# A Guide To Using Bet Royale

Note: This project is still in beta.

This is a guide on how to use Bet Royale.

## What Do You Need To Do Everything On This Website?

You need a Metamask wallet and a Discord account, that's all you need. You need both your Metamask wallet and Discord account in order to bet. In order to create bets, you just need your Discord account.

## The Home Page

The Home Page is where you can see the current bets that are active.

## The Create Bet Page

The Create Bet page is where you create bets. You have to set parameters such as: Name, Description Deadline, Results, etc. Remember, when setting a deadline and result, you are setting them in UTC time, so be aware of everyone's timezones when setting those parameters.

## The Betting History Page

The Betting History Page is where you can see your history of bets you have betted on.

That's all you need to know when using this website!
